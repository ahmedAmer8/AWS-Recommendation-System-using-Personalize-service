# Building a Movie Recommender with Amazon Personalize and MovieLens: An End-to-End Guide

This document provides a complete walkthrough for building a powerful movie recommendation engine using Amazon Personalize. We will start with a well-known public dataset (MovieLens), process it into the required format, set up all the necessary AWS infrastructure, and overcome the most common and frustrating permission errors that developers face.

### **Project Goal:**
To build and deploy a movie recommendation system by training a machine learning model on user interaction data.

### **Key Stages:**
1.  **Data Preparation:** Selecting the MovieLens dataset and converting it into a Personalize-compatible format.
2.  **Infrastructure Setup:** Creating and configuring the S3 bucket and a dedicated IAM Role.
3.  **Solving the Permissions Puzzle:** Correctly configuring the S3 bucket policy to grant access to the Amazon Personalize service.
4.  **Building in Personalize:** Creating the Dataset Group, defining the data schema, and importing our prepared data.

## Part 1: Data Preparation with the MovieLens Dataset

The foundation of any good machine learning model is high-quality data. We will use the popular **MovieLens 25M Dataset**, which contains millions of movie ratings and is ideal for this task.

Amazon Personalize requires interaction data in a specific format, with three mandatory columns: `USER_ID`, `ITEM_ID`, and `TIMESTAMP`.

*   `USER_ID`: A unique identifier for each user.
*   `ITEM_ID`: A unique identifier for each item (in our case, a movie).
*   `TIMESTAMP`: The time of the interaction, in **Unix epoch timestamp format**.

### Step 1.1: Scripting the Data Transformation

We will use a Python script with the `pandas` library to load the raw MovieLens data, select the necessary columns, rename them to match Personalize's requirements, and save the result as a single `interactions.csv` file.

**Python Script (`prepare_data.py`):**
```python
import pandas as pd

# Define the paths to your downloaded movielens files
ratings_path = './ml-25m/ratings.csv'
movies_path = './ml-25m/movies.csv'

print("Loading data...")
# Load the ratings data
ratings_df = pd.read_csv(ratings_path)

# Load the movies data (optional, for context)
movies_df = pd.read_csv(movies_path)

print("Data loaded successfully.")

# --- Data Transformation for Amazon Personalize ---

# 1. Select only the required columns from the ratings data
# We only need userId, movieId, and timestamp for the interactions schema
interactions_df = ratings_df[['userId', 'movieId', 'timestamp']].copy()

# 2. Rename the columns to match the Personalize schema requirements
interactions_df.rename(columns={
    'userId': 'USER_ID',
    'movieId': 'ITEM_ID',
    'timestamp': 'TIMESTAMP'
}, inplace=True)

# 3. Ensure data types are correct (IDs as strings, timestamp as long)
# Personalize treats IDs as strings, so it's best practice to cast them.
interactions_df['USER_ID'] = interactions_df['USER_ID'].astype(str)
interactions_df['ITEM_ID'] = interactions_df['ITEM_ID'].astype(str)

# The timestamp is already in the correct Unix epoch format, so no conversion is needed.

# 4. Save the prepared data to a new CSV file without the header
output_csv_path = 'interactions.csv'
print(f"Saving prepared data to {output_csv_path}...")
interactions_df.to_csv(output_csv_path, index=False, header=True) # header=True is fine, Personalize can handle it

print("Data preparation complete.")
print("\nFirst 5 rows of the final interactions.csv:")
print(interactions_df.head())
```

Run this script in the same directory where you extracted the MovieLens files. It will generate an `interactions.csv` file, ready for Amazon Personalize.

## Part 2: Setting Up the AWS Infrastructure

With our data ready, we need to create a home for it in the cloud and establish the necessary permissions.

### Step 2.1: Create an S3 Bucket

1.  Navigate to the **S3** service in the AWS Management Console.
2.  Click **Create bucket**.
3.  Enter a **globally unique bucket name** (e.g., `movielens-personalize-data-[your-initials]`).
4.  Select the **AWS Region** where you plan to run Amazon Personalize.
5.  Keep the default settings for the rest of the options and click **Create bucket**.

`[Image Placeholder 2: Screenshot of the "Create bucket" screen in the S3 console with the name and region fields filled out.]`

Once the bucket is created, open it and click **Upload**. Add the `interactions.csv` file you generated in Part 1.

`[Image Placeholder 3: Screenshot of the S3 bucket view showing the uploaded interactions.csv file.]`

### Step 2.2: Create the IAM Role for Personalize

Amazon Personalize needs permissions to access other AWS services (like S3) on your behalf. We create an IAM Role for this purpose.

1.  Navigate to the **IAM** service in the AWS Console.
2.  Click **Roles** in the left navigation pane, then **Create role**.
3.  For "Trusted entity type", select **AWS service**.
4.  For "Use case", choose **Personalize**. This automatically establishes the correct trust relationship, allowing the Personalize service to assume this role.

`[Image Placeholder 4: Screenshot of the "Select trusted entity" screen in IAM, with "AWS service" and "Personalize" highlighted.]`

5.  Click **Next**. On the "Add permissions" page, search for and select the policy `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`. This gives the role permission to list buckets and read objects.
6.  Click **Next**.
7.  Give the role a descriptive name, like `PersonalizeS3AccessRole`, and click **Create role**. **Make sure to copy the Role ARN**, as you will need it later.

`[Image Placeholder 5: Screenshot of the IAM role creation final screen, showing the role name and the attached AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess policy.]`

### Step 2.3: The Critical Fix - Configuring the S3 Bucket Policy

This is the step that trips up most developers. The IAM role allows Personalize to *act*, but the S3 bucket itself must explicitly allow the Personalize *service* to enter.

1.  Navigate back to your S3 bucket's page.
2.  Click on the **Permissions** tab.
3.  Scroll to **Bucket policy** and click **Edit**.
4.  Paste the following JSON policy. This policy grants the `personalize.amazonaws.com` service principal—not the IAM role—permission to get objects and list the bucket contents.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "PersonalizeS3BucketAccessPolicy",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PersonalizeS3BucketAccessPolicy",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "personalize.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
**Important:** Replace `your-bucket-name` with the actual name of your S3 bucket.

5.  Click **Save changes**.

## Part 3: Building the Foundation in Amazon Personalize

Now we can finally start working in the Amazon Personalize console.

### Step 3.1: Create a Dataset Group

A dataset group acts as a container for your data, models, and campaigns.

1.  Navigate to the **Amazon Personalize** service in the AWS Console.
2.  Click **Create dataset group**.
3.  Enter a name (e.g., `MovieLensRecommender`) and select the **Custom** domain.
4.  Click **Create dataset group**.

`[Image Placeholder 7: Screenshot of the "Create dataset group" screen in the Personalize console.]`

### Step 3.2: Create the Interactions Dataset and Schema

Next, we define the structure of our data.

1.  Inside your new dataset group, under "Create datasets", click **Create interactions dataset**.
2.  Give the dataset a name (e.g., `movielens-interactions`).
3.  For the schema, select **Create a new schema**.
4.  Define the schema by pasting the following JSON, which exactly matches the columns in our `interactions.csv` file.

```json
{
    "type": "record",
    "name": "Interactions",
    "namespace": "com.amazonaws.personalize.schema",
    "fields": [
        {
            "name": "USER_ID",
            "type": "string"
        },
        {
            "name": "ITEM_ID",
            "type": "string"
        },
        {
            "name": "TIMESTAMP",
            "type": "long"
        }
    ],
    "version": "1.0"
}
```

`[Image Placeholder 8: Screenshot showing the schema definition being created for the interactions dataset.]`

5.  Click **Next** and **Finish**.

`[Image Placeholder 9: Screenshot of the dataset dashboard after the interactions dataset has been created.]`

### Step 3.3: Import the Data

The final step is to create a job that pulls the data from S3 into Personalize.

1.  From your dataset group dashboard, find the interactions dataset and click **Import data**.
2.  Give the import job a name (e.g., `initial-movielens-import`).
3.  For **S3 URI**, provide the exact path to your data file: `s3://your-bucket-name/interactions.csv`.
4.  For **IAM Role**, select **Use an existing IAM role** and choose the `PersonalizeS3AccessRole` you created earlier.

`[Image Placeholder 10: Screenshot of the "Create dataset import job" configuration screen, with S3 URI and IAM role fields filled.]`

5.  Click **Finish**. The import job will start. You must wait for its status to change from "Create in progress" to **Active** before proceeding to model training.
