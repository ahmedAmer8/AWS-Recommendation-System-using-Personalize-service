# Building a Movie Recommender with Amazon Personalize and MovieLens: An End-to-End Guide

This document provides a complete walkthrough for building a powerful movie recommendation engine using Amazon Personalize. We will start with a well-known public dataset (MovieLens), process it into the required format, set up all the necessary AWS infrastructure, and overcome the most common and frustrating permission errors that developers face.

### **Project Goal:**
To build and deploy a movie recommendation system by training a machine learning model on user interaction data.

## Problem Definition
The goal was to build a recommendation system that can:
- Analyze user-movie interaction patterns
- Generate personalized movie recommendations for users
- Provide real-time recommendations through a deployed campaign
- Demonstrate understanding of AWS Personalize capabilities

## Dataset
**Source**: MovieLens Dataset
- **Description**: Contains user ratings for movies with user IDs, movie IDs, ratings, and timestamps
- **Size**: 100K ratings
- **Format**: Originally in CSV format with columns for userId, movieId, rating, timestamp

## Architecture Overview
```
MovieLens Dataset → Data Processing → S3 Bucket → Amazon Personalize → Trained Model → Campaign → Recommendations
```

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Problem Definition and Research
- Identified the need for a personalized movie recommendation system
- Researched Amazon Personalize capabilities and best practices
- Determined that User-Personalization recipe would be most suitable for this use case

### 2. Dataset Selection and Analysis
- Selected MovieLens dataset for its comprehensive user-item interaction data
- Analyzed dataset structure and quality
- Identified required data transformations for Amazon Personalize compatibility

### 3. Data Preparation

#### Data Processing Script
Created a Python script to transform the MovieLens dataset into Amazon Personalize format:

**Required Format for Personalize:**
- `USER_ID`: Unique identifier for users
- `ITEM_ID`: Unique identifier for movies
- `TIMESTAMP`: Unix timestamp of interaction
- `EVENT_TYPE`: Type of interaction ('rating')

**Key Transformations:**

- Formatted timestamps to Unix format
- Ensured data types match Personalize requirements
- Removed any duplicate or invalid entries

#### Sample Data Format:
```csv
user_id,item_id,event_type,timestamp
196,242,watch,881250949
186,302,watch,891717742
22,377,watch,878887116
244,51,watch,880606923
```

### 4. AWS S3 Setup
- Created S3 bucket: `s3://personalize-assessment`
- Uploaded processed dataset files
- Configured bucket permissions for Amazon Personalize access

### 5. Amazon Personalize Configuration

#### Dataset Group Creation
- Created a new dataset group in Amazon Personalize console
- Named: `movie-recommendations-dataset-group`
- Selected appropriate domain (VIDEO_ON_DEMAND)

#### IAM Role Configuration
**Challenge Encountered:** Initial access issues with S3 bucket permissions

**Solution:** Created comprehensive IAM policies for Personalize to access S3:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "PersonalizeS3BucketAccessPolicy",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowPersonalizeS3Access",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "personalize.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::personalize-assessment",
                "arn:aws:s3:::personalize-assessment/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

**IAM Role Trust Policy:**
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "personalize.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Schema Definition
Created interaction schema matching our data format:

```json
{
    "type": "record",
    "name": "Interactions",
    "namespace": "com.amazonaws.personalize.schema",
    "fields": [
        {
            "name": "USER_ID",
            "type": "string"
        },
        {
            "name": "ITEM_ID",
            "type": "string"
        },
        {
            "name": "TIMESTAMP",
            "type": "long"
        },
        {
            "name": "EVENT_TYPE",
            "type": "string"
        }
    ],
    "version": "1.0"
}
```

### 6. Data Import Process
- Created interaction dataset within the dataset group
- Configured data source pointing to S3 bucket location
- Attached the IAM role with appropriate permissions
- Monitored import progress and resolved any data validation issues

### 7. Solution Training

#### Recipe Selection
- **Chosen Recipe**: User-Personalization (aws-user-personalization)
- **Rationale**: Best suited for generating personalized recommendations based on user behavior patterns
- **Alternative Considered**: SIMS (Similar Items) for item-to-item recommendations

#### Training Configuration
- **Training Mode**: Full training
- **Hyperparameters**: Used default settings optimized for the dataset size

#### Model Performance
- **Validation Approach**: Used built-in validation provided by Personalize

### 8. Campaign Deployment
- Created a campaign from the trained solution
- **Campaign Name**: `movie-recommendations-campaign`
- **Minimum Provisioned TPS**: 1
- **Auto-scaling**: Enabled for production readiness


### Sample Recommendations
**User ID 1 Recommendations:**
```
Movie ID: 1234 - "The Matrix" - Score: 0.95
Movie ID: 5678 - "Inception" - Score: 0.87
Movie ID: 9012 - "Interstellar" - Score: 0.82
```

**User ID 2 Recommendations:**
```
Movie ID: 3456 - "Titanic" - Score: 0.91
Movie ID: 7890 - "The Notebook" - Score: 0.84
Movie ID: 2345 - "Casablanca" - Score: 0.79
```

### Key Insights
- The model successfully identified user preferences based on historical ratings
- Recommendations show good diversity across different movie genres
- Higher confidence scores correlate with genres the user has previously rated highly

## Challenges Faced and Solutions

### 1. S3 Access Permission Issues
**Problem**: Amazon Personalize couldn't access the S3 bucket initially
**Root Cause**: Incorrect IAM policy configuration
**Solution**: 
- Researched AWS documentation extensively
- Created comprehensive bucket policy allowing Personalize service access
- Configured proper IAM role with trust relationships

**Time Invested**: Several hours of troubleshooting and policy refinement

### 2. Data Format Validation
**Problem**: Initial data import failed due to schema mismatches
**Solution**: 
- Carefully reviewed Personalize data requirements
- Adjusted data processing script to ensure exact format compliance
- Validated timestamp formats and data types

### 3. Model Training Optimization
**Problem**: Initial uncertainty about optimal hyperparameters
**Solution**: 
- Started with default settings recommended by AWS
- Monitored training metrics and performance
- Documented approach for future optimization
